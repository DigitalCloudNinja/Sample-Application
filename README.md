2.  **Install Docker Desktop on Windows**:

    *   Once the installer is downloaded, double-click on the installer file (`Docker Desktop Installer.exe`) to begin the installation process.
    *   Follow the on-screen instructions. You may need to approve the installation using administrative privileges.

3.  **Install Docker Desktop on Mac**:

    *   Once the installer is downloaded, open the downloaded file (`Docker.dmg`).
    *   Drag the Docker Desktop application to the Applications folder to begin the installation.

4.  **Run Docker Desktop**:

    *   After the installation is complete, launch Docker Desktop from the Applications folder on Mac or the Start menu on Windows.
